# Sound Recognition System

## Description
This project implements a sound recognition system in Rust. The goal is to classify environmental sounds using audio data and machine learning techniques.

## Requirements
- **Rust** 
- Libraries:
  - `cpal` – for real-time audio handling
  - `hound` – for processing WAV files
  - `ndarray` – for numerical computations


## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the [ESC-50](https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50) repository, which contains environmental sound recordings grouped into 50 classes.
